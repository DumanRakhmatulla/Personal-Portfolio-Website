            <p>
              These are my very first classmates. Of course, I can say that this
              was one of the most exciting and memorable moments of my life.
              Together, we took our first steps into school, studied our first
              lessons, and overcame various challenges and joys together. Every
              day spent with my classmates holds great significance for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              The friendship and bond we built over the years have become an
              inseparable part of my life. Even though we have all taken
              different paths, the shared memories from our school days will
              remain in our hearts forever.

            <p>
              My main goal for the UNT was to score over 100 points. To achieve
              this, I put all my effort into preparation. During my preparation
              for the UNT, I only attended a course for mathematics, as I did
              not have enough financial resources to participate in courses for
              all subjects.

            Since 2022, I have been studying at SDU University, where I am
            pursuing a degree in IT from the Faculty of Engineering. I chose
            this major of my own accord and I do not regret this decision. The
            field of IT is fascinating and constantly evolving, making it a
            dynamic area of study. Although the learning process can be
            challenging at times, it has greatly expanded my knowledge and
            allowed me to acquire new skills.
